**Workshop Management**

A web application for workshop management is essential for modern workshops looking to streamline their operations, improve customer service, and increase productivity. By automating manual processes and providing real-time data analysis, the application can help managers make informed decisions and improve overall workshop performance. The approach to designing the workshop management web application was a user-centred design approach. We first conducted research to understand the needs and pain points of workshop organizers. This involved conducting interviews with workshop organizers, surveying potential users, and analysing competitor applications. From these interviews we discovered three key areas which needed focus. focus: booking, inventory, and employee management. The booking system allows for easy scheduling and registration, with real-time visibility into workshop availability. The inventory management system helps track and manage workshop resources, with real-time inventory level visibility. The employee management system provides tools for scheduling, attendance tracking, and payroll management, with real-time visibility into employee availability and performance.
Using the information we obtained from our clients, we decided to use the following applications to develop the web application. The website's front-end will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The website will feature a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. The website's design will be responsive, ensuring that it is accessible from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The back end of the website will be developed using Node.js and Express. The Node.js code will handle user requests and connect to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library to store and retrieve data. The back end will be designed to provide a seamless experience for the user, ensuring that the website is fast and responsive. The website will integrate with third-party APIs, such as payment gateways, to enable customers to pay for their services online. The APIs will be integrated using Node.js and Express. The website will be developed with security in mind. The website will use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, ensuring that user data is secure. The website will also be developed with strong password policies, two-factor authentication, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Overall, the website will provide an efficient way for customers to engage with the workshop and enable workshop owners to manage their business operations effectively.
